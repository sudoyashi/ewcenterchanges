- Issues with responsive css implementation for weblog page, since there is no way to upload code directly to website for the changes, I will have to find a work around to create a better table. Table currently is with NO style because of this. 
- Table draft can be found in the Pages > Weblog DRAFT WITH TABLES page

10:40pm
- **Table draft is looking better. Will need to push my works another day because I didn't see that I could not upload my previously written code, but should still be within the May 17 deadline.**
- Issue was that I had previously assumed I could upload my personal code, that is not the case with this particular WP site. I had to do a workaround as a result of being a different environment from my dev environment.
