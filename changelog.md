## 5/16/2019
- LOTS of links to create thumbnails for... will need more time because I will need to go through a lot more embed code than anticipated

## 5/15/2019 Revised  excursion map with new color icons

5:47pm
- Added new maps! Maps are made with icons for travelling. I was quite unsure to add the legend considering that there are so few differing elements. However, new legend can be made upon request, but I would advise against it for the sake of simplicity. The icons make it obvious enough.
- Two versions were made, one including Sukothai and one without.

## 5/14/2019 Table complete, added placeholder image and pages for each category

9:28pm
- *Marking Section 1 complete, for now* Implemented proposed changes for six discussion pages indicated in **Section 1.** 
- Table with a 3x2 matrix created, responsive and tested ONLY on desktop with different screen sizes. Will test again with different screen sizes on 5/16
- Created 6 dummy pages to link to each specific category. Dummy pages are NOT published. Attributes: Full-width page, Weblog set as parent page. All changes can be made in less than 1 hour for all 6 pages as needed.

## 5/13/2019 Drafting HTML Table

7:00pm
- Issues with responsive css implementation for weblog page, since there is no way to upload code directly to website for the changes, I will have to find a work around to create a better table. Table currently is with NO style because of this. 
- Table draft can be found in the Pages > Weblog DRAFT WITH TABLES page

10:40pm 
- **Table draft is looking better. Will need to push my works another day because I didn't see that I could not upload my previously written code, but should still be within the May 17 deadline.**
- Issue was that I had previously assumed I could upload my personal code, that is not the case with this particular WP site. I had to do a workaround as a result of being a different environment from my dev environment.
